The 1D chart is updated every minute with real time data, and back filled with 15 minute data.
So a 1D chart will be complete by 4:15 ET. OHLC endpoint should be complete a little after 4pm.
Some exchanges report official close later than 4pm.
There are cases where the official close could go as long as 5pm ET before being published.

The first availability of the data for the current day in a daily chart (e.g. 1 month period) should be 11pm ET.

Full day coverage for US equities means 4am-8pm ET.
Right now our systems at IEX are only online from 8am-5pm ET,
so we only publish prices during those hours.

IEX will continue to provide real time pricing from 8-5pm.
For 4am-8am and 5pm-8pm, we have to stick to 15 min delayed for now.
Very few places display real time pricing after regular market hours due to very thin trading.
Real time pricing can also get very expensive not only for us to distribute,
but for you the user if you need to do anything with the data.
We are looking into as many options as possible while trying to keep the cost and legal paperwork
to a minimum for our users.

IEX earnings API is grossly incorrect, just as Yahoo's.
Schwab one is correct, but their website is slow and you have to log in first.
