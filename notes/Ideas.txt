Valuation.

There are dozens of inputs that drive value, but there is going to be one variable
that does this more than any other - the value driver. It will give you focus.

For FB - operating margins.
For NFLX - growth in content cost.
For GOOG - revenue growth and operating margins.

How do you find that number?
1) By looking at what variable changes your value as you change that variable.
2) The uncertainty you feel about the value - if you feel very certain about
   about the operating margins, then this is not your value driver.

Even for the same company, two people might now fixate on the same value.
