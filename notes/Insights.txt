By JAMES "REV SHARK" DEPORRE:

When the market is acting poorly, investors look for explanation and they focus on things
that appear to be negative. They seek logical explanations for the price action
and suddenly the news that was benign and ignored in January 2018 is now negative.
Back in January even talk about nuclear testing by North Korea couldn't hurt the market
but now (April 30) peace talks can't help it.

It is important to understand that this is just the nature of the market beast.
The cycle of ups and downs has always existed and we are now going through a corrective phase.
There is nothing surprising or unusual about it.

This action may make for some unpleasantness if you are holding stocks but this is the sort of
action that always leads to a new crop of opportunities.
We just have to stay patient and let the cycle play out.

The best advice I can give is to not try to anticipate a low.
Wait for the price action to improve. When the market regains its health it will trend up
for days and weeks and there will be plenty of time to put capital back to work.

Trying to time the exact moment the market is counterproductive.
Focus on potential buy candidates and then watch them as they develop.
There is no need to buy them when they are sinking.
